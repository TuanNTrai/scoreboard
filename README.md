## Motivation

It seems no one wants to be an accountant when we are playing so I wrote this so that the accountant can be switched in the middle of the game.

Created for mobile use. For best usability [add app to homescreen](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/).

## Features
- [x] [Live demo](https://games.miikka.xyz/)
- [x] Easy to use ( buttons are big enough, circular navigation )
- [x] Accountant can be switched in the middle of the game
- [x] Creates my most played courses **automatically** if user is near
- [x] Fast rendering time
- [x] Hosted on DigitalOcean behind nginx
