</h1>

<h4 align="center">Simple score tracker for golf and disc golf. Made with Vue & Go :heart:</h4>
<br>

## :question: Motivation

It seems no one wants to be an accountant when we are playing. I wrote this so that the accountant can be switched in the middle of the game.

Created for mobile use. For best usability [add app to homescreen](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/).

## :dart: Features

:heavy_check_mark: [Live](https://games.miikka.xyz/).  
:heavy_check_mark: Create pars **automatically** if the user is close to a [supported](https://github.com/tuommii/scoreboard/blob/master/assets/courses.json) course.  
:heavy_check_mark: Accountant can be switched in the middle of the game.  
:heavy_check_mark: Easy to use.  

## :memo: Technical features
:heavy_check_mark: Demonstrates Go's concurrency features nicely.  
:heavy_check_mark: Server can [save and restore](https://github.com/tuommii/scoreboard/blob/master/cmd/scoreboard/main.go#L40) it's state.  
:heavy_check_mark: Each game in memory has it's own mutex instead of one global for all games. 
:heavy_check_mark: [Automatic deployment](https://github.com/tuommii/scoreboard/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L1) with Github Actions.  
:heavy_check_mark: JSON structure is designed to be easily upgradable.  
:heavy_check_mark: Azure Pipelines & Docker.  
:heavy_check_mark: Good rendering time.  
:heavy_check_mark: Hosted on DigitalOcean behind nginx.  
:heavy_check_mark: nginx gzip & cache (may vary during development).
